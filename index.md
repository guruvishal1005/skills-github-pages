## About Me
Hello, my name is Guru Vishal, and I’m currently in my first year of B.E. in Computer Science Engineering (Cyber Security) at Chennai Institute of Technology. I am from Chennai, and have lived here my entire life. Growing up in this city has shaped a lot of my experiences and interests, and I’m excited to be starting this new phase of interest in technology.

For my schooling, I attended Narayana E Techno School, where I spent several years building a strong foundation in various subjects. Over time, I developed an interest in technology, particularly computers. This interest gradually turned into a passion for cyber security, which is why I chose this field of study. While I’ve always enjoyed working with computers, what excites me most about this subject is how it can contribute to making the digital world safer.

Outside of academics, I have many interests that help me maintain a balanced life. One of my passions is music. I’ve been learning to play the piano for some time now, and it’s a great way for me to relax and unwind. Music helps me express myself creatively and has always been a comforting part of my routine. I also believe in staying physically fit, so I make sure to work out regularly. It’s not just about staying healthy; working out also helps me stay focused and energized throughout the day.

Another thing I enjoy is traveling. I love exploring new places, whether it’s within the city or traveling to different regions. I find that traveling helps me gain new perspectives and learn about different cultures. It’s something I really look forward to whenever I get the chance. Traveling opens my mind to new experiences, and I enjoy the opportunity to meet new people and see the world from different viewpoints.

When it comes to communication, I’ve always enjoyed talking to others and getting to know them. However, I recognize that communication is an area where I can continue to improve. I am working on becoming more confident and effective in expressing myself, as I believe that good communication is key to building meaningful relationships with people.


In summary, I’m someone who loves learning, exploring new things, and growing as a person. I’m excited to be here in college and look forward to all the opportunities that lie ahead. I’m sure this journey will be full of challenges, but I’m ready to embrace them and make the most of my time here.
